## Your Turn

- What do you do at Posit?
- How have you used LLMs/AI tools up until now?
- What was your skepticism/enthusiasm score (1 to 5)?
- In one or two sentences, how do you feel about AI?

## The Plan

::: {.incremental}
- **Now:** Quick Start course on LLMs. You will leave having run some LLM requests at least.
- **Next 48 hours:** Hack on stuff! "Rules" on the next slide.
- **Thursday:** Show and tell, share lessons learned, reflections.
:::

## Hack On Stuff

- **Does NOT have to be relevant to your day job, or Posit, or data science.**\
  This exercise is about learning and engagement, not ROI.
- **Does NOT have to be a finished product/demo/app/API.**\
  Showing some things you did in a notebook is fine as long as YOU found it interesting.
- **Does NOT have to use Posit products.**\
  You may use any framework, any language,any service that you have access to.

## Hack On Stuff

- **Does NOT have to be an original idea.**\
  You can build on existing projects, improve on existing demos, etc.
- **Does NOT even have to be coding.**\
  Do a deep dive into an AI service or piece of software. Make an interesting project on ChatGPT Playground > Assistants, or assemble a useful NotebookLM and see what its limits are.
- **Does NOT have to be a success.**\
  Negative results (“I thought LLMs could do this but turns out they can’t”) are useful results as well. But please be prepared to talk about what you tried.

## Let It Rip

All that said... also feel free to throw down, and make something super cool!

## A Caveat From IT

No _proprietary_ code or data is allowed to be sent to any LLM service (except Copilot), for now. (Pending IT/legal review.)

- Sending open source code to these services is fine though.

- Sending proprietary code/data to _local_ models is also fine. Ask in `#hackathon-03` if you need help setting up a local model.
